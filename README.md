## ✨ Key Features

### 🔐 Secure User Authentication
- Complete user registration, login, and secure session management using Django's built-in authentication system.
- Custom user models tailored to store specific user financial profiles.
- **Premium Profile Page:** A centralized, sleek dashboard for managing user settings and viewing financial summaries.

### 📊 Advanced Budget Tracking
- **Create & Manage Budgets:** Users can define categories, allocate maximum budgets, and track their expenses seamlessly.
- **Dynamic Status Tracking:** Budgets automatically calculate percentages and dynamically update their status (`On Track`, `Near Limit`, `Exceeded`).

### 💸 Income & Expense Management
- **Integrated Transactions:** Record both income and expenses with detailed descriptions and payment methods.

    - **Income:** Adding income to a specific budget category automatically increases its total limit.
    - **Expenses:** Recording expenses automatically deducts from the relevant budget's remaining balance.
- **Detailed History:** Track every financial movement with a clean, searchable transaction list.

### 🎯 Smart Savings Goals
- **Goal Setting:** Users can set specific financial targets (e.g., "Buy a Car", "Emergency Fund") with a target deadline.
- **Progress Tracking:** The app calculates live progress percentages and dynamically changes the UI color based on completion (e.g., green for completed, orange for in-progress).
- **Monthly Breakdown:** The system automatically calculates how much a user needs to save per month to reach their goal by the deadline.

### 📈 Financial Dashboard & Reports
- A clean, intuitive, and responsive **Vanilla CSS** frontend providing a premium user experience.
